The nl-aspell package includes the GPL COPYRIGHT file but no explicit copyright
notice.  Since he was using autoconf this could have been added automatically.

One of the main word lists he used had the following copyright notice:

patterns (patronen) Nederlandstalige TeX Gebruikersgroep, Postbus 394,

All provided material can be used freely. Copying is only allowed if
the package is distributed complete and unchanged. We plan to update
the package on a regular basis. Bug reports and bugfixes are welcomed.
